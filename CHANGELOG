Released on 2018
-------------------------
1. (in previous commit) Change compile command for OS X in src/Makefile from g++-5 to
g++. This prevented compilation on OS X with up-to-date gcc/g++ installations.

2. Added FieldComponent and SourceComponent "enums" to ensure internal consistency
when retrieving field and source quantities.

3. Changed grid.Material2D.get_values_on to grid.Material2D.get_values_in. Identical
change for grid.Material3D. Furthermore, an optional parameter "squeeze" hass been
added to both Material2D and Material3D which, when set to True, will squeeze out any
length-1 axes from the array. For example, if you want to extract a line from a 2D
Material, then setting squeeze=True will cause the vector which is returned to have
shape (N,). This can be useful for things like plotting.

4. Overhaul of full vector mode solver (now call ModeFullVector). Solver interface has 
been changed a bit and now accepts Material2D/Material3D objects and a DomainCoordinates
to extract the material slice for which the mode is calculated (this change is needed 
for the solver to work properly and it should also make the usage of the mode solve 
less verbose for users). The modes and eigenvalues of the new mode solver have been 
compared against commercial packages and it appears to produce accurate results. At this 
point, the ModeFullVector class should be ready for prime time. 

Furthermore, the ModeFullVector class can now be used to calculate current sources
for exciting waveguide modes in 3D simulations. These waveguide modes can be injected
along any cartesian axis.

5. Renamed Mode_TE to ModeTE and Mode_TM to ModeTM for the sake of internal
consistency.

6. Changed the ModeTE and ModeTM init function to match ModeFullVector. These objects
how accept eps, mu, and a DomainCoordinates and the material distribution is
extracted from those. This, once again, reduces code verbosity a bit and will also
allow us to handle certain internal calculations more effectively (i.e. take
adavantage of grid smoothing better, calculate sources which can inject along either
x or y axis, etc).

7. Fixed some errors in the documentation at the top of modes.py

8. Updated examples according to library changes.

9. Implemented rough 3D solver. Note: This is NOT ready for use, however the
foundation is set. Due to the structure of the 3D equations, a preconditioned
iterative solver is used. The preconditioner combines multigrid with an A^H matrix
preconditioner (which produces makes the system positive semi-definite) and uses
GMRES as a smoother. GCR with restart is used for the outer iteration and MUMPS/LU
factorization is used for the coarse solve. Currently, this works "well enough,"
however it is still very slow compared to FDTD (for example). The 3D solver interface
will be improved in the near future and hopefully be made useable.



Released on March 5, 2018
-------------------------
1. Implemented "general" DomainCoordinates when now replaces LineCoordinates and
PlaneCoordinates. The DomainCoordinates takes the following parameters as input:
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, dx, dy, dz. All must be specified when creating a
DomainCoordinates object. In order. When all values are unique, the DomainCoordinates
corresponds to a rectangular volume. Planes can be specified by specifying the same
value for two of the min/max parameters. For example, to create a plane normal to the
z-direction located at z=0.5:

    plane = DomainCoordinates(0, W, 0, H, 0.5, 0.5, dx, dy, dz)

In 2D, the exact value for dz is unimportant as long as it is not zero. It is
recommended that 1.0 be used. In order to specify a line, two of the min/max pairs
must have the same values. For example, to create a line along the x direction at
y=0.75, and z=0.5:

    line = DomainCoordinates(0, W, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, dx, dy, dz)

This way of handling slicing sub domains of the simulation allows for a simpler
codebase and also makes slicing domains consistent in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.

2. Fixed license discrepancy in python documentation

3. Crated new emopt.io module which now houses save_results, load_results, and
plot_iteration

4. Removed emopt.modedata module. Use emopt.modes instead (it is plenty fast).

5. Replaced plot_iterations function with new plot_iteration function (notice that
new function does not end in 's'). The old function was a bit hacky and the results
were not very pleasant to look at. The new function should produce a more informative
plot. Furthermore, it manages plot placement in a more sophisticated way, which
should make it better for structures with different aspect ratios. Finally, plots can
be generated with either a dark or light color scheme (dark is the current default).
This was a personal choice as I generally write code using editors with darker color
schemes, so the new dark scheme is gentler on my eyes :)

6. Refactored code in preparation for 3D code in the future. The following classes
have been renamed:

    emopt.grid.Material -> emopt.grid.Material2D
    emopt.grid.GridMaterial -> emopt.grid.GridMaterial2D
    emopt.grid.StructuredMaterial -> emopt.grid.StructuredMaterial2D

7. The ordering of index ranges in emopt.grid.Material2D.get_values() has been
modified such that it is consistent with get_value. It now takes the form
    
    get_values(k1, k2, j1, j2)

where k1 to k2 is the range of x coordinates (columns in array storage) and j1 to j2
is the range of y coordinates (rows in array storage).

8. A new Material2D structure called ConstantMaterial2D has been added which can
(should) be used for totally uniform structures. This will be faster than using a
StructuredMaterial2D for things like uniform permeability which is often the case in
silicon photonics.

9. All of the examples have been updated and tested.

----------------------------
Note: This is the first entry to the CHANGELOG

1. Fixed boundary condition bugs in mode solver (the problem only manifested if the
permittivity and permeability were uniform across the entire simulation domain and
thus likely did not affect most if any actual simulations.)

2. Changed how PMLs are set. Now, PML is not passed to the constructor of the FDFD
object. Instead, it defaults to a half wavelength everywhere and can be set using the
w_pml property. e.g.

     sim = FDFD_TE(W,H,dx,dy,wlen) 
     sim.w_pml = [1, 1, 1, 1]

3. Introduced ability to change boundary conditions in FDFD_TE and FDFD_TM. This is
accomplished using the "bc" property. The bc property is a 2 character string which
specifies the boundary condition along the x and y directions in the simulation
region. The default value is '00' which corresponds to perfect electrical conductors
on all four edges. The boundary conditions that are currently implemented are

     0 - "perfect electric conductor" : the boundaries of the simulation perfectly
     conduct electrical current.

     M - "perfect Magnetic conductor" : the boundaries of the simulation perfectly
     conduct magnetic current (magnetic monopoles). In most cases, this likely be
     used explicitly by the user.  
     
     E - "Electric field symmetry": the electric field is mirrored across the
     bottom boundary of the simulation domain (y=0).
     
     H - "Magnetic field symmetry": the magnetic field is mirrored across the
     bottom boundary of the simulation domain (y=0). 
     
     P - "Periodic"

Furthermore, in the future, Bloch periodic boundary conditions (B) will be
implemented.

In addition to choosing the desired boundary conditions, the PML widths must be
changed accordingly. For example, if you choose your boundary condition to be '0E'
(PEC on left and right boundaries, E symmetry on bottom boundary, and PEC on top
boundary), then you must be also careful to set the bottom PML width to be 0.0. EMOpt
will throw a warning if you do not do this, so keep an eye out.

Important note: some testing has been done to verify the different boundary
conditions work as intended, however this testing is not exhaustive. 

Examples demonstrating the new boundary conditions can be found in
examples/simple_waveguide/ and examples/periodic_Mie

4. These same boundary conditions have been implemented in the 1D mode solver. The
boundary condition for the mode solver is specified (in most cases) with a length-1
string (i.e. '0', 'M', 'E', 'H', or 'P'). These boundary conditions are designed to
be compatible with the FDFD solver's boundary conditions. In particular, if you
choose E-field symmetry ('E'), for example, the result modes will have an electric
field which is mirrored across the bottom (y=0) boundary. 

5. Fixed bug in source power calculation which occurs when zero-width PMLs are used.
