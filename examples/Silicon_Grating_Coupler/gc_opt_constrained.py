"""
This file demonstrates how to run a constrained optimization of a
partially-etched grating coupler. This example builds off of the gc_opt.py
example and must be run after gc_opt.py has completed.

The structure of the constrained optimization is almost identical to the
unconstrained optimization. The primary difference is that we introduce a
penalty term to the figure of merit which reduces the value of the figure of
merit when slots in the grating become too narrow. This penalty term is an
explicity function of the slot widths of the grating. Similarly, the gradient
must be modified accordingly. These modifications are introduced through the
implementation of the :func:`calc_y` and :func:`calc_grad_y` functions.

Because this penalty term is an explicit function of the slot widths, it
becomes convenient to parameterize the grating in terms of the individual slot
widths and periods. This has an added benefit that it would allow us to
optimize with bounds (we do not currently do this).

In addition to these mode fundamental changes, we tweak the optimization
process. First, we use the solution of the unconstrained optimization as the
starting point for this constrained optimization. Next, we run a sequence of
three separate optimizations. In the first optimization, the penalty term is
very weakly waited. In the second optimization, the penalty term is weighted
more heavily. In the third optimization, the penalty term is strongly weighted
and the minimum feature size is more strictly enforced. This process has proven
to yield good results, but tweaking may be required depending on the exact
application.

When working through this example, you should first scroll to the bottom of the
file to main section, i.e.

    if __name__ == '__main__':

and read through how the simulation is setup.  Then, look over the
:class:`.SiliconGratingAM` class which demonstrates the core components of an
adjoint-method-based optimization.

Finally, to run the code, execute::

    mpirun -n 16 python gc_opt_constrained.py

in the command line which will run the optimization using 16 cores on the current
machine.
