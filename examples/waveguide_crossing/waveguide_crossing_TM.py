"""Run a simple optimization of a MMI (multimode interference) waveguide
crossing.

This example demonstrates how to run a simple optimization of a crossing
structure which looks like:

                      |      |
                      |      |
           /----------        -----------\
    ------/                               \------
 input ->                                    output ->
    ------\                               /------
           \----------        -----------/
                      |      |
                      |      |

The goal of the optimization is to maximize the fraction of power which leaves
through the output waveguide. This is accomplished by modifying 3 design
variables:

    1) the width of the wider multimode crossing waveguide
    2) the length of the crossing waveguide
    3) length of the tapers on either side.

The input waveguide width is fixed.

It is worth noting that this example is a bit contrived as it can actually be
solved largely by hand. Nonetheless, it is a nice gentle introduction to
optimization with emopt.

On most *nix-based machines, run the script with:

    $ mpirun -n 8 python waveguide_crossing_TM.py

If you wish to increase the number of cores that the example is executed on,
change 8 to the desired number of cores.

    """Define an adjoint method class which calculates the figure of merit and
    its gradient for the waveguide crossing structure.

    In general, there is a lot of overhead associated with running
    optimizations of complex electromagnetic structures.  Gremlin attempts to
    alleviate the burden of dealing with some of this complexity by
    implementing a set of base classes which handle the problem-agnostic
    components of the adjoint method. This leaves only the problem-specific
    pieces which must be defined by the user. In particular, at a bare minimum,
    you must define:

        1) A function which updates your structure given a set of design variables
        2) A function which calculates the figure of merit
        3) A function which calculates the derivative of the figure of merit
        with respect to each of the relevant field components.

    With these three functions defined, we can optimize the electromagnetic
    structure.

    In emopt, the implementation of these functions is handled by extending a
    base AdjointMethod class and implementing the required abstract methods.
    There are a number of AdjointMethod classes to choose from:

        1) AdjointMethod : This is the simplest and should be used when your
        merit function is independent of the materials of the system and does
        not require power normalization.
        2) AdjointMethodPNF : This is for figures of merit which have source
        power normalization.
        3) AdjointMethodFM : This is for figures of merit which depend on the
        materials of the system
        4) AdjointMethodMO : This provides a simple way of combining multiple
        AdjointMethods to allow for optimizations of figures of merit which
        combine multiple objective functions (e.g. optimizing over multiple
        wavelengths, etc)

    It is highly recommended that you read the documentation for the
    AdjointMethod class and the relevant subclasses.

        The figure of merit for our crossing optimization is the

        the mode of the output waveguide. This is a very common figure of merit
        in silicon photonics applications. As such, emopt.fomutils provides
        functions to aid in the calculation of mode matches.

        This function accepts the simulation object and current set of design
        parameters and returns a single real scalar which gives the figure of
        merit. Gremlin always minimizes the figure of merit, so we need to
        multiply the mode match by -1 in order to ensure that it is actually
        maximized.

        See AdjointMethodPNF's documentation for details about implementing
        this function.

        Note: because emopt is built on top of MPI, this function is called on
        every processor. The desired fields, meanwhile, are generally known
        only on the master node (broadcasting the same fields to all of the
        nodes is both unnecessary and expensive, in general).  To make dealing
        with this easier, we use the @run_on_master flag to ensure that this
        function is only run on the master node and then access the fields
        which were saved to the master node immediately after the simulation
        was performed.

        Alternatively, we could have allowed this function to run on all nodes,
        use the FDFD.get_fields_interp(...) function and then put the actual
        calculations in a if(NOT_PARALLEL) block.

        An essential part of computing gradients with the adjoint method is the
        calculation of the derivative of the figure of merit with respect to
        the fields at each spatial index, dF/dx.  Because power normalization is
        handled by the underlying adjoint method implementation that we have
        chosen, we only need to compute df/dx, where F = f/Psrc.

        Notice that f(x) is a functional (takes a vector and returns a scalar)
        of the vector x. The derivative df/dx is thus also a vector of the
        form df/dx = [df/dx1, df/dx2, ..., df/dxN] where x1, x2, ..., xN refer
        to the list of field components at the different spatial indices. In
        this case, we have non-zero Hz, Ex, Ey and thus df/dx will look like

                     df/dEy11, df/dEy12, ...]

        Because our figure of merit is an analytic function, it is
        straightforward to write down and compute its derivative. Note that
        when handling integral functions, it is important to cast them first as
        a discrete sum of indexed elements before differentiating.

        As with calc_f(...), we wrap the function in @run_on_master to ensure
        that the computation is only performed on the master node and retrieve
